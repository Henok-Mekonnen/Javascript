    <h1>
        Short version of my life story
    </h1>
    <p>My name is Henok Mekonnen I was born and raised in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia,
        also the diplomatic center of Africa. Before I move to United States in January 2015, I was living
        with my mother, three of my brothers, two of my sisters, two of my nephews and one of my nieces.
        my father passed away when I was 12 years old, he was one of the well reputed civil case lawyers in
        the city and was the bread maker for the family. after finishing my high school, beside doing my
        college degree I was handling some family responsibilities on helping my mother.

    <p>After graduating from law school, I was practicing in the federal supreme court of Ethiopia as a clerk
        and case briefer for assistant judge. Even if I was not happy with the situation of the work and the
        payment, stayed until the end of the contract hoping to get some experience to practice as an
        independent lawyer. But after I finished my contract, I got an opportunity to work for an international
        company as a data clerk through one of my friends, a computer graduate. Even if it doesnâ€™t relate with
        my study, I was attracted by the payment, it was more than five times what I was getting. So, I convinced
        myself to get the job to make some saving for my future. Doing this introduced me with computer science.
